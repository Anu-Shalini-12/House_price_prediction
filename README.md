# House_price_prediction
## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting house prices using Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. The dataset is provided by a US-based housing company named Surprise Housing, which is planning to enter the Australian market.

## Project Structure

- `house_price.py`: Main Python script containing the code for training the machine learning models.
- `house_price_test.py`: Script for testing the trained models on a separate test set.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Libraries Used

This project utilizes the following Python libraries:

- **pandas:** A powerful data manipulation and analysis library.
- **scikit-learn:** A machine learning library providing tools for classification, regression, clustering, and more.
- **TensorFlow:** An open-source machine learning framework developed by Google.
- **keras:** An open-source deep learning library that works on top of TensorFlow.

To install these libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
